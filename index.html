        <h1>About Andrew Le</h1>
        <p>As my programming knowledge is expanding through my studies in UTCS and self-teaching, I've enjoyed my experiences creating a variety of programs using different technologies. I seek opportunities to challenge myself and expand my skillset, and I am excited to explore my potential of how I can make an impact through computer science, whether it be through software engineering, data science, machine learning, or something else. I'm open to the many possibilities in this field and am excited about how they could change our future.</p>
        <p>I'm driven to develop projects meant for a cause, to solve problems, or to enhance the quality of life of a target audience. I'm always open to feedback and criticism on my work to figure out how I can improve, and I observe the impact of my work to see what kinds of additional features users could benefit from.</p>

            <h1>Piano Life</h1>
            <p>My most prominent hobby besides coding is playing the piano, which I've done for over 10 years! I've performed in numerous events, such as high school talent shows while duoing with my best friend Jordan, and most recently, at my sister's wedding.</p>
            <p>I was taught by my piano teacher, Diane Barnhart, during my middle and high school years. Through her lessons, I had the opportunity to play in many recitals and audition for the National Piano Guild for 5 consecutive years, winning awards for my excellent performance.</p>

            <h1>Asian Potluck</h1>
            <p>My CS homies and I decided that we needed some time outside of the computer labs at the UT GDC and decided to go to each others' apartments and cook. Thus, Asian Potluck was born, and we started hosting potlucks every two weeks.</p>
            <p>We always go all out on our cooking, and enjoy stuffing ourselves once we feast. We show off our unique creations: my main dishes are fish sauce wings and truffle scalloped potatoes! My friends have made dishes such as vodka sauce pasta, onion soup mac n' cheese, you name it!</p>

            <h1>My Meme Channel</h1>
            <p>Dragon Ball has been my favorite franchise throughout my life. Its most recent series is Dragon Ball Super, and while watching it air live in Japan, I randomly started making compilations. One of them was of the laughter of a villain named Frieza (titled "OHOHOHOHO").</p>
            <p>In December 2017, that video started going viral, gaining almost 100,000 views every day. It currently has over a million views, along with two of my other videos. <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8fPAMcNffG2HhrJMsCZLIQ" target="_blank">My channel</a> started gaining tons of subscribers (nearly 17,000 right now!), and I made DBS memes regularly.</p>

            <h2>Clash Royale Trade Helper Bot</h2>
          </a>
          <p>A Discord web-scraping bot that uses endpoints from <a class="ext-link" href="https://docs.royaleapi.com/#/">RoyaleAPI</a> to show players' card quantities in the mobile game Clash Royale. Discord users can input various commands (who has or who wants a card, which cards of a certain player are tradable), create a wishlist of cards they want, and display a list of smart trade results based on everyone's wishlists.</p>
          <p>The bot was initially created using Java, with a MySQL backend to map Discord users to their player tags (using Hibernate) so their player information can be retrieved through HTTP requests. Wishlists were stored in a local directory as JSON files.</p>
          <p>My main contributions to this bot included:
            <ul>
              <li>Using HashMaps and functional programming to change the display of smart trade results to show in the order of frequency of possible trades</li>
              <li>Filtering the smart trade list down to giving away only cards that the player has maxed</li>
              <li>Creating a priority system using a new JSON field to allow users to indicate which card they wanted most, so smart trade results would only show prioritized wishes, narrowing down options to be more accurate for a higher trade success rate</li>
              <li>Allowing the whoWants command to accept a rarity parameter, to show a list of which players want every card of that rarity</li>
              <li>Removing maxed cards from players' wishlists automatically upon calling a command</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>CodePath Android University</h2>
          </a>
          <p>A series of Android Java applications created using Android Studio through a remote class on <a class="ext-link" href="https://codepath.org/">CodePath</a>. These apps included a Flixster app that showed the most popular movies that are now playing, as well as Twitter and Instagram clone apps. The Flixster and Twitter apps used an API to retrieve data, while the Instagram app used a Parse backend to store users and posts.</p>
          <p>This remote class taught students the fundamentals of creating Android apps, including:
            <ul>
              <li>How to change the layout of activities/fragments to improve the UI</li>
              <li>Creating a RecyclerView and using an adapter to populate it with data</li>
              <li>Using intents to navigate between activities and pass data through them</li>
              <li>Using get and post requests to compose and submit posts, and to refresh the feed/timeline</li>
              <li>Setting up an authentication system for accounts, and persisting logged in accounts and data offline</li>
