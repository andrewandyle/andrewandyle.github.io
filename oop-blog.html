        <h1>Blog #13 (Week of 11/16 - 11/22)</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>What did you do this past week?</li>
          <p>My partner and I wrapped up the Life project. It seems like we overestimated this project, and after going through a tough time with the Darwin project, we breezed through this one. Having previous experience with inheritance helped a lot, as well as using office hours immediately when running into C++ class errors.</p>
          <li>What's in your way?</li>
          <p>With the OOP projects done and nearly every project wrapped up for all classes (just need to take care of Modern Web Apps), I have to begin studying for my exams. I don't have finals, only last exams just like this class. I thought this exam would be Monday, December 7th, but it got pushed forward to the 3rd and 4th, landing on the same day as my MWA exam on Friday. Really sucks to get overwhelmed on that one day, but that day is now the end of my semester!</p>
          <li>What will you do next week?</li>
          <p>I will finish my one remaining assignment over the weekend, then continue to grind out for work until I go home on Wednesday, since I've put a lot more emphasis on school than work lately. Then I will relax for Thanksgiving, and then use the weekend to study for my exams and do the HackerRanks for this class.</p>
          <li>If you read it, what did you think of What Happens to Us Does Not Happen to Most of You?</li>
          <p>The paper's topic of community awareness regarding these ethical and behavioral issues in the workplace (sexism, harassment, racism) is important to keep in mind. It's easy to forget due to the benefits of pursuing a career in computer science that these types of experiences exist among others and could drive them out of the field.</p>
          <li>What was your experience of inheritance?</li>
          <p>It felt like a refresher from learning inheritance from Java, but with the added complications of using pointers with parent/child classes in C++. Inheritance is such an important topic for object-oriented development that I can often get confused on, but I found the concepts this week to be very clear!</p>
          <li>What made you happy this week?</li>
          <p>I started off the week feeling overwhelmed because of all my due dates landing at both the middle of this week and the beginning of next week. But I went really hard on one assignment at a time, rather than trying to split up my hours on each of them per day. This seemed to work well, because I've cleared up all but one of my school deadlines before the weekend hit. I'm happy and relieved that this week went better than I thought it would in terms of productivity.</p>
          <li>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li>
          <p>My pick-of-the-week is <a class="ext-link" href="https://codepath.org/classes" target="_blank">CodePath</a>, a nonprofit that offers free remote courses for CS students. I took one of their courses for Android last fall, and it was my first exposure to mobile development. They mostly do mobile development, cybersecurity, and technical interview courses (usually over the summer), so I feel like they're good to have on top of your university courses. At least in my Android class, the content was well-paced and clear, the workload was light, and the projects went on my GitHub. The course was something I could add on to my portfolio. (I even have a <a class="ext-link" href="codepath.html" target="_blank">page</a> on this website covering some of what I've learned!)</p>

        <h1>Blog #12 (Week of 11/9 - 11/15)</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>What did you do this past week?</li>
          <p>I got started on the Life project with my partner. So far, we seem to be smooth sailing, and it really helps that we already had experience working on the Darwin project. At the moment, we've set up the 5 classes and we have to connect it to the I/O to see if they work. Hopefully this project won't have us as stuck as Darwin.</p>
          <li>What's in your way?</li>
          <p>Work is ramping up, as I have to deal with sprint/milestone deadlines and stay on schedule for work, as well as prepare for both an exam and iOS presentation next week. I need to go hard on all of my deadlines next week, because once Thanksgiving week hits and I go back home to my family, it will be super difficult to stay on pace!</p>
          <li>What will you do next week?</li>
          <p>I will once again have to balance all of my tasks, while putting priority on what's due first. I am hoping to get the Life project done with my partner before next weekend hits. Though that's not as urgent as my other school deadlines, it would be nice to get OOP out of the way so I can relax a bit more on the same week as Thanksgiving Break.</p>
          <li>If you read it, what did you think of The New Methodology?</li>
          <p>As someone who uses Agile methodologies every day at work (usually scrum), I really liked this article because it effectively compared traditional methodologies to Agile by describing the differences between predictive and adaptive approaches, and clearly outlined the difficulties that can occur with following traditional methodologies.</p>
          <li>What was your experience of containers, container adapters, and Life?</li>
          <p>I felt that this week's concepts were easier to grasp, probably because the containers we went over should be familiar from Data Structures. But I found it interesting when comparing the best choices for underlying containers for each of them, basing them off of factors such as indexing and resizing. It felt like the iterators topic again, when we would decide on what strength of iterator we would need.</p>
          <li>What made you happy this week?</li>
          <p>I just signed an internship offer with Citi! I'm super excited for next summer!!!</p>
          <li>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li>
          <p>My pick-of-the-week is <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>, a React-based framework that makes starting a website easier. There are lots of quick tutorials on it, so even people without much experience coding up websites could use it. I've seen it recommended a lot of times online, as well as a couple of times at UTCS events. I will finally give it a shot and replace my personal website by making a new portfolio using Gatsby. </p>
          <p>I made this website back when I lacked exprience with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so I wasn't sure if it was a good idea to use something like Gatsby that sets up most of the front-end for you. I think making a basic website like this was a great learning curve, but I think it's finally time for me to abandon it. I'll also move all my blogs over to my new site.</p>

        <h1>Blog #11 (Week of 11/2 - 11/8)</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>What did you do this past week?</li>
          <p>My partner and I wrapped up the Darwin project and passed all the HackerRank test cases. After submitting the project, I got slammed on by the workload for my iOS team's Beta Release, but I managed to get that finished too. I seem to have gotten better at juggling multiple projects, as I've made an effort to distribute all my school/work hours evenly throughout the day instead of working 8am–5pm with only an hour of break, then losing motivation. This way, I could even work from 8am all the way up to midnight without tiring out.</p>
          <li>What's in your way?</li>
          <p>The Darwin project took way longer than expected. It was already time-consuming figuring out what kind of design for our classes would be considered good, and we constantly changed our implementation to avoid the use of getters/setters. Then there was figuring out our optimization, which we barely managed to figure out before deciding to give up on the last case. We based our expected finish time off of how we did on the previous projects, but then our actual finish time was over double those hours.</p>
          <li>What will you do next week?</li>
          <p>I plan on securing a partner for Project 5 and immediately getting to work on it. If the Darwin project was already tough enough to have my partner and I invest way more time than expected and use office hours a lot, then I'd rather not underestimate this one too. I hope I can keep up a consistent work schedule with my next partner as usual, working 2 hours a day (and ramping it up when the deadline approaches) and making the most of them through constant discussion.</p>
          <li>If you read it, what did you think of The Dependency Inversion Principle?</li>
          <p>I found it really interesting and liked how clear and concise the explanations were for the benefits of using abstract classes. Though this is something most CS students likely get taught early on, this article offered great and simple examples of how not using abstract classes can lead to any of the traits that consider a software design to be bad.</p>
          <li>What was your experience of continuing to implement std::vector, move semantics, and allocators again?</li>
          <p>These concepts were brand new to me, and took me a bit of time to grasp them so I struggled when immediately going into the HackerRanks. Implementing move semantics and allocators address important efficiency issues for vectors, such as preventing unnecessary copies when taking in an r-value, as well as the O(n) fill operation upon every vector construction regardless of the data type.</p>
          <li>What made you happy this week?</li>
          <p>I thought I finally deserved to treat myself after such a heavy project deadline week. I looked up food recommendations and tried two new restaurants back-to-back: Bar Peached on W 6th St, and Lucky Robot on S Congress Ave (in South River City). I tried their most popular dishes which I saw before deciding on those places, and they were amazing and definitely worth it. They're also quite expensive though, but I haven't spent much money on eating out since COVID.</p>
          <li>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li>
          <p>My pick-of-the-week is <a class="ext-link" href="https://theleanway.net/muda-mura-muri" target="_blank">this article</a> that covers a work model (known as the Toyota 3M model) that aims to eliminate workflow inefficiency by looking at 3 issues: Muda (waste), Mura (unevenness), and Muri (overburden). My scrum team focuses on this, and every time we do a sprint reflection, we try to identify any instances of these 3 that happened throughout the sprint, and come up with solutions to apply to our next sprint in the form of kaizen (continuous improvement).</p>
